- **.dockerignore**: Specifies files and directories to ignore when building the Docker image.

- **README.md**: Documentation for the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET SDK
- Docker (if running in a container)

### Running the Application

1. **Standalone**:
   - Navigate to the `src` directory.
   - Run the application using the command:
     ```
     dotnet run
     ```
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or the port shown in the console) to see the current date and time.

2. **Docker/Podman**:
   - Build the Docker image using the command:
     ```
     docker build -t dotnet-date-time-app .
     ```
     Or with Podman:
     ```
     podman build -t dotnet-date-time-app .
     ```
   - Run the container using the command (map your desired host port, e.g. 5001, to container port 8080):
     ```
     docker run -d -p 5001:8080 dotnet-date-time-app
     ```
     Or with Podman and a specific container name:
     ```
     podman run -d --name date-time-app -p 5001:8080 dotnet-date-time-app
     ```
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5001` to see the current date and time.

## Docker Hub Workflow

### 1. Build the Docker Image

Replace `yourdockerhubusername` with your Docker Hub username:

```sh
docker build -t yourdockerhubusername/dotnet-date-time-app:latest .
```

### 2. Publish (Push) the Image to Docker Hub

First, log in to Docker Hub if you haven't already:

```sh
docker login
```

Then push the image:

```sh
docker push yourdockerhubusername/dotnet-date-time-app:latest
```

### 3. Pull the Image from Docker Hub

On any machine with Docker installed, pull the image:

```sh
docker pull yourdockerhubusername/dotnet-date-time-app:latest
```

### 4. Run the Image

Run the container, mapping your desired host port (e.g., 8067) to the container port (e.g., 80):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8067:80 --name dotnet-date-time-app yourdockerhubusername/dotnet-date-time-app:latest
```

Now, open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8067](http://localhost:8067).

## GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) Workflow

### 1. Pull the Image from GHCR

Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/dotnet-date-time-app:latest
```

If the image is private, authenticate first:

```sh
echo $GITHUB_TOKEN | docker login ghcr.io -u YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME --password-stdin
```

### 2. Run the Image from GHCR

Run the container, mapping your desired host port (e.g., 8067) to the container port (e.g., 80):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8067:80 --name dotnet-date-time-app ghcr.io/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/dotnet-date-time-app:latest
```

Now, open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8067](http://localhost:8067).

> **Note:**
> Replace `your_token_here` with your actual GitHub Personal Access Token.
> The script uses your GitHub username as configured inside the script.

> **Note:**
> By default, .NET 8+ containers listen on port 8080. Adjust the `-p` flag as needed.
> You can use [Podman](https://podman.io/) as a drop-in replacement for Docker.
> All `docker` commands above work the same way with `podman` (e.g., `podman build ...`, `podman run ...`).
